  <h2>Semantic Thought Network</h2>
  <p>Active Knowledge Graphs drive business intelligence and business processes with natural language. They integrate with existing sources of facts, create new knowledge and pertinent conclusions -- beyond just retrieving facts already known to the system.</p>
  <p>Under the hood, they combine large language models, automatically extended ontologies and knowledge graphs.</p>
  <p>This connection of language models with precise ontologies and knowledge graphs allows to correctly apply and confirm legal reasoning with error detection and correction, as needed for due diligence documentation.</p>
  <p>I initially focus on in title search and the ensuing practical conclusions.</p>
